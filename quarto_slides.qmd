- The `index.qmd` file must be named exactly as it is `index.qmd`. 

- The `index.qmd` file must be placed in the root folder next to the `_quarto.yml`.

## How do it all come together?

```
my-website/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ _quarto.yml       ‚Üê üîß Configuration file
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ styles.css        ‚Üê üé® Custom styling (optional)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ index.qmd         ‚Üê üè† Home page
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ about.qmd         ‚Üê üìÑ Additional page
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ _site/            ‚Üê üåê Rendered website output (auto-generated)

```

The goal today is to make sure that everyone will have a working website published on Github Page to take home!
